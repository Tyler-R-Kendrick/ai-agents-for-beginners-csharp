# Shiki Magic Move

Powered by [shiki-magic-move](https://shiki-magic-move.netlify.app/), Slidev supports animations across multiple code snippets.

Add multiple code blocks and wrap them with <code>````md magic-move</code> (four backticks) to enable the magic move. For example:

````md magic-move {lines: true}
```ts {*|2|*}
// step 1
const author = reactive({
  name: 'John Doe',
  books: [
    'Vue 2 - Advanced Guide',
    'Vue 3 - Basic Guide',
    'Vue 4 - The Mystery'
  ]
})
```

```ts {*|1-2|3-4|3-4,8}
// step 2
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      author: {
        name: 'John Doe',
        books: [
          'Vue 2 - Advanced Guide',
          'Vue 3 - Basic Guide',
          'Vue 4 - The Mystery'
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```ts
// step 3
export default {
  data: () => ({
    author: {
      name: 'John Doe',
      books: [
        'Vue 2 - Advanced Guide',
        'Vue 3 - Basic Guide',
        'Vue 4 - The Mystery'
      ]
    }
  })
}
```

Non-code blocks are ignored.

```vue
<!-- step 4 -->
<script setup>
const author = {
  name: 'John Doe',
  books: [
    'Vue 2 - Advanced Guide',
    'Vue 3 - Basic Guide',
    'Vue 4 - The Mystery'
  ]
}
</script>
```
````

## Running the Code

This course offers a series of Jupyter Notebooks that you can run with to get hands-on experience building AI Agents.

The code samples use either:

**Requires GitHub Accont - Free**:

1) Semantic Kernel Agent Framework + GitHub Models Marketplace. Labeled as (semantic-kernel.ipynb)
2) AutoGen Framework + GitHub Models Marketplace. Labeled as (autogen.ipynb)

**Requires Azure Subscription**:
3) Azure AI Foundry + Azure AI Agent Service. Labeled as (azureaiagent.ipynb)

We encourage you to try out all three types of examples to see which one works best for you.

Whichever option you choose, will determine which setup steps you need to follow below:

## Requirements

- Python 3.12+
- A GitHub Account - For Acces to the GitHub Models Marketplace
- Azure Subscription - For Access to Azure AI Foundry
- Azure AI Foundry Account - For Access to the Azure AI Agent Service

We have included a `requirements.txt` file in the root of this repository that contains all the required Python packages to run the code samples.

You can install them by running the following command in your terminal at the roof of the repository:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
We recommend creating a Python virtual environment to avoid any conflicts and issues.

## Set Up for Samples using GitHub Models 

### Step 1: Retrieve Your GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)

Currently, this course uses the Github Models Marketplace to offer free access to Large Language Models (LLMs) that will be used to create AI Agents.

To access this service, you will need to create a GitHub Personal Access Token.

This can be done by going to your <a href="https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens" target="_blank">Personal Access Tokens settings</a> in your GitHub Account.

Select the `Fine-grained tokens` option on the left side of your screen.

Then select `Generate new token`.

![Generate Token](./images/generate-token.png)

You will be prompted to enter a name for your token, select the expiration date (Recommended: 30 Days), and select the scopes for your token (Public Repositories).

Copy your new token that you have just created. You will now add this to your `.env` file included in this course. 


### Step 2: Create Your `.env` File

To create your `.env` file run the following command in your terminal.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

This will copy the example file and create a `.env` in your directory and where you fill in the values for the environment variables.

With your token copied, open the `.env` file in your favorite text editor and paste your token into the `GITHUB_TOKEN` field.

You should now be able to run the code samples of this course.

## Set Up for Samples using Azure AI Foundry and Azure AI Agent Service

### Step 1: Retrieve Your Azure Project Connection String

Follow the steps to creating a project and agent in Azure AI Foundry found here: [Create a project in Azure AI Foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/agents/quickstart?pivots=ai-foundry-portal?WT.mc_id=academic-105485-koreyst)

Once you have created your project, you will need to retrieve the connection string for your project.

This can be done by going to the **Overview** page of your project in the Azure AI Foundry portal.

![Project Connection String](./images/project-connection-string.png)

### Step 2: Create Your `.env` File

To create your `.env` file run the following command in your terminal.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

This will copy the example file and create a `.env` in your directory and where you fill in the values for the environment variables.

With your token copied, open the `.env` file in your favorite text editor and paste your token into the `PROJECT_CONNECTION_STRING` field.

### Step 3: Sign in to Azure

As a security best practice, we'll use [keyless authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/ai/keyless-connections?tabs=csharp%2Cazure-cli?WT.mc_id=academic-105485-koreyst) to authenticate to Azure OpenAI with Microsoft Entra ID. Before you can do so, you'll first need to install the **Azure CLI** per the [installation instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?WT.mc_id=academic-105485-koreyst) for your operating system.

Next, open a terminal and run `az login --use-device-code` to sign in to your Azure account.

Once you've logged in, select your subscription in the terminal.


## Additional Envionment Variables - Azure Search and Azure OpenAI 

For the Agentic RAG Lesson - Lesson 5 - there are samples that use Azure Search and Azure OpenAI.

If you want to run these samples, you will need to add the following environment variables to your `.env` file:

### Overview Page (Project)

- `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` - Check **Project details** on the **Overview** page of your project.

- `AZURE_AI_PROJECT_NAME` - Look at the top of the **Overview** page for your project.

- `AZURE_OPENAI_SERVICE` - Find this in the **Included capabilities** tab for **Azure OpenAI Service** on the **Overview** page.

### Management Center

- `AZURE_OPENAI_RESOURCE_GROUP` - Go to **Project properties** on the **Overview** page of the **Management Center**.

- `GLOBAL_LLM_SERVICE` - Under **Connected resources**, find the **Azure AI Services** connection name. If not listed, check the **Azure portal** under your resource group for the AI Services resource name.

### Models + Endpoints Page

- `AZURE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING_DEPLOYMENT_NAME` - Select your embedding model (e.g., `text-embedding-ada-002`) and note the **Deployment name** from the model details.

- `AZURE_OPENAI_CHAT_DEPLOYMENT_NAME` - Select your chat model (e.g., `gpt-4o-mini`) and note the **Deployment name** from the model details.

### Azure Portal

- `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` - Look for **Azure AI services**, click on it, then go to **Resource Management**, **Keys and Endpoint**, scroll down to the "Azure OpenAI endpoints", and copy the one that says "Language APIs".

- `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` - From the same screen, copy KEY 1 or KEY 2.

- `AZURE_SEARCH_SERVICE_ENDPOINT` - Find your **Azure AI Search** resource, click it, and see **Overview**.

- `AZURE_SEARCH_API_KEY` - Then go to **Settings** and then **Keys** to copy the primary or secondary admin key.

### External Webpage

- `AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION` - Visit the [API version lifecycle](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/api-version-deprecation#latest-ga-api-release) page under **Latest GA API release**.

### Setup keyless authentication

Rather than hardcode your credentials, we'll use a keyless connection with Azure OpenAI. To do so, we'll import `DefaultAzureCredential` and later call the `DefaultAzureCredential` function to get the credential.

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential, InteractiveBrowserCredential
```

## Stuck Somewhere?

If you have any issues running this setup, hop into our <a href="https://discord.gg/kzRShWzttr" target="_blank">Azure AI Community Discord</a> or <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/ai-agents-for-beginners/issues?WT.mc_id=academic-105485-koreyst" target="_blank">create an issue</a>.

## Next Lesson

You are now ready to run the code of this course, happy learning more about the world of AI Agents!

# Monaco Editor

Slidev provides built-in Monaco Editor support.

Add `{monaco}` to the code block to turn it into an editor:

```ts {monaco}
import { ref } from 'vue'
import { emptyArray } from './external'

const arr = ref(emptyArray(10))
```

Use `{monaco-run}` to create an editor that can execute the code directly in the slide:

```ts {monaco-run}
import { version } from 'vue'
import { emptyArray, sayHello } from './external'

sayHello()
console.log(`vue ${version}`)
console.log(emptyArray<number>(10).reduce(fib => [...fib, fib.at(-1)! + fib.at(-2)!], [1, 1]))
```
